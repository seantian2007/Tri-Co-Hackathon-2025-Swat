### Next Steps

Dev-side:
- Working on the individual components of the system (backend, data management system, user interface)
- Conducting the integration test by stimulating real-time user behaviors

Consumer-side:
- Collecting user feedback
- Capturing the behavioral pattern of Queen Bees and Worker Bees by monitoring the data collected
- Conducting capacity test simultaneously

Further prospects:
- Implementing the Campus Cash system in a way that’s similar to the SWAT point.
- Giving more meal plan options similar to Swarthmore’s, allowing students to choose if they’d prefer more meal swipes/dining dollars/campus cash.
- Partnering with businesses to allow the Campus Cash to be used on off-campus sites.
